# Electron Vue Webpack template
Got tired finding Electron 5 / Vue 2 / Webpack 4 templates with fancy add-ons you don't really need?

Give a try to this minimal template with very few dependencies for quick development and prototyping.

![w10 sample](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11739632/19222705/0f8c55fc-8e5f-11e6-97fa-0d3943f43358.png)

## Install
``` bash
# Clone the repository once
$ git clone https://github.com/pastahito/electron-vue-webpack

# Go into the repository (rename it as you wish)
$ cd electron-vue-webpack

# Install the 7 only dependencies once
$ npm install
```

## Usage
Run this two commands in two different prompts to start developing with hot reloading.
``` bash
# Webpack builds once and watches to apply only the changes
$ npm run dev

# Start you electron app
$ npm start
```

## What's included
You don't really need more stuff to start playing around with Electron 4, Vue 2 and Webpack 4.

- Support for .vue (single file components). Use them with HTML & ES6 & CSS.
- No Express, neither Babel is needed (more than 97% ES6 is supported in Node/Electron).
